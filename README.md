# 🔥 **Anonymous Chat Application** 🤫

Welcome to the **Anonymous Chat App**! It’s where your secrets are safe, your jokes fly freely, and your conversations stay between you, yourself, and the infinite void (well, also the other anonymous users 😜). Powered by **Socket.IO** and **Kotlin**, this app is built for those who just want to chat without knowing who is on the other side. No names. No faces. Just fun conversations!

## Features 🌟
- **Anonymous chatting**: No need to sign up or log in. Just chat and have fun! 💬
- **Real-time communication**: Thanks to **Socket.IO**, the conversations flow as smoothly as your coffee. ☕
- **Minimalistic design**: A simple, clean interface. Because who needs anything complicated when you're here for the jokes? 🎨
